The boot loader uses three interfaces to define and customize its behavior.

Boot Loader IO Interface:

The boot loader IO interface definitions provide control inputs and status
outputs that the boot loader can use to determine when it should load a new
application image and how it should report its status.

Boot Loader Media Interface:

The boot loader media interface definitions provide access to the boot image 
medium and the ability to read the file.

Boot Loader Interface

The Loader interface definitions provide any data translation and Flash 
programming necessary to load the boot image into program Flash memory.

These interface routines can be implemented via macros or functions as 
required.
