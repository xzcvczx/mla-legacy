===========================================================================================
Programs built in the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET languages normally require a
.NET framework redistributable pacakge to be installed on the PC before they can be run.

The GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe and HID PnP demo.exe programs were written in 
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.  These programs require .NET framework version
2.0 or later installed in order to run.

The GenericHIDDLLSimpleDemo.exe program was written in Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition.  
This demo requires .NET framework version 3.5 or newer to run.

If you do not have a new enough .NET framework redistributable installed, a non-descript error 
message will occur when trying to launch the executable, and the program will not open.  The 
.NET framework v3.5 redistributable is currently (13 July 2009) available at: 

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6&displaylang=en

You may already have the .NET framework installed on your PC, especially if you have already installed
other applications which were built with one of the Visual Studio .NET languages.  Users of Windows Vista
do not need to install the .NET framework to run Visual Studio .NET 2005 based programs, as the v2.0 
redistributable already comes pre-installed as part of the OS.  However, in order to run the Visual Sudio
.NET 2008 based programs, it will still be necessary to obtain and install the v3.5 redistributable,
if it has not already been installed.


These demos programs can be modified and rebuilt using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition. 
Microsoft currently distributes this development environment free, and it can be obtained from 
http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/default.aspx.  (Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 express 
edition is no longer available for download, but 2008 edition can upgrade the 2005 based projects).
