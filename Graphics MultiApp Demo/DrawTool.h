 Function: WORD MsgDrawTool(WORD objMsg, OBJ_HEADER* pObj, GOL_MSG* pMsg)
                                                                       
 Overview: This function is called by GOLMsg() function when in this 
 		   particular demo each time the valid message is received for the 
  		   objects in the demo.
 		                                                                          
 Input: objMsg - translated message for the object,
        pObj - pointer to the object,
        pMsg - pointer to the non-translated, raw GOL message 
                                                                       
 Output: If the function returns non-zero the message will 
 		 be processed by the object directly affected by the message.
 		 Default action on the object based on the message will be 
 		 performed.
