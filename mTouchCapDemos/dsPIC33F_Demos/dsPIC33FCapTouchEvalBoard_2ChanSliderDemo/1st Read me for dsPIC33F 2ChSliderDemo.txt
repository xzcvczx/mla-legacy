Enhanced mTouch Capacitive Touch Eval. Kit: dsPIC33F_mTouchCap_2ChSliderDemo
============================================================================

What This Demo Does
-------------------
This demo supports the two channel slider daughter card.  In it two ADC
channels are used to measure your finger position along slider and between
one and sixteen LEDs are lit to indicate the sensed position.


Required Development Resources:
-------------------------------
a. Enhanced mTouch Capacitive Touch Evaluation Kit (DM183026-2)
   (2-Channel Slider Sensor Daughter Board, PICKit Serial Analyzer)
b. dsPIC33F Capacitive Touch Evaluation Board (AC??)
c. A debugging/programming development tool
    - PICkit 3 In-Circuit Programmer/Debugger (PG164130), or
    - MPLAB ICD 3 In-Circuit Debugger (DV164035), or
    - MPLAB REAL ICE In-Circuit Emulator (DV244005) 
      and the RJ-11 to ICSP Adapter (AC164110)
d. MPLAB IDE V8.63 or better
e. C30 Compiler V3.30


Optional Development Resources:
-------------------------------
a. PICKit Serial Analyzer (PKSA) (DV164122)
   (If not using the Enhanced mTouch Capacitive Touch Evaluation Kit)
b. Button daughter card adapter
   (Provides 100K pull-ups to reference pin to support differential CVD.
    Instructions on how to make are provided below.)


Compiling and Downloading the Demo:
-----------------------------------
1. Extract the contents of the .ZIP file to someplace convenient on your hard
   drive.  The folder's MPLAB project is self-contained, and can be moved to
   any location after extraction, as long as the directory names inside the 
   project are not changed or the contents moved.

2. Load the demo code into MPLAB by double clicking the appropriate
   dot mcp project file:
   
        dsPIC33FCapTouchEvalBoard_2ChSliderDemo.mcp .

2. Connect the REAL ICE debugger to J1 on the evaluation board's left edge.
   .
3. Power up the board by connecting a USB port on your computer to the mini-B
   port on the evaluation board's left edge.
   
4. Choose the REAL ICE debugger tool in MPLAB IDE by selecting
   Debugger>Select Tool and then click on 6 REAL ICE.
   
   The REAL ICE tab of the output window should display something like this:
   
        MPLAB REAL ICE detected
        Connecting to MPLAB REAL ICE...
        Firmware Suite Version...... 01.26.81
        Firmware type......................dsPIC33F/24F/24H
        MPLAB REAL ICE Connected.
        Target Detected
        Device ID Revision = 0000300a

5. Build the project by selecting Project>Build All.

6. Download your code into the evaluation board microcontroller by
   selecting Debugger>Program .
   
7. Run the demo code by selecting Debugger>Run.
   (The LEDs on the top side of the board should all light up, starting with
    the right (LED 1) and ending with the left-most (LED 16).  Then the LEDs
    should turn off in the reverse order.)


Loading PICKit Serial Analyzer Firmware
---------------------------------------
Out of the box the PICKit Serial Analyzer (PKSA) does not support the serial
data stream provided by the demo. Firmware must be loaded using the application
found in the directory

    .\ProfiLabGUIs\mTouch GUI\Pickit Serial Loader

Launch the executable PickitLoaderAuto.exe to load the firmware.  Follow the
instructions shown in the dialog window to reset the PKSA and then to load
the Windows device driver after the PKSA is programmed.


Running the Demo:
-----------------
This demo displays the button or slider status on the row of LEDs.
Additionally, the UART interface to the PKSA can display button signals and
decoded status using a Profilab executable found in a subdirectory of the 
project.

1. After the PICKit Serial Analyzer (PKSA) drivers have been installed, 
   connect it to the evaluation board:
   
        J2 RF4 <---> PKSA Pin 1 (Tx) (optional)
        J2 RF5 <---> PKSA Pin 6 (Rx)
           GND <---> PKSA Pin 3 (GND)
           
   Connect the PKSA to your computer using a USB cable.  Depress the PKSA push
   button until all three LEDs light.  Then release the button.  If the UART 
   interface on the evaluation board is operating the red "Busy" LED should
   light, showing that there is UART traffic between the demo application and
   the PKSA.

   The UART interface runs at 115.200 kbaud, no parity, 8 bits, no stop bit.
   Typically the PKSA driver provides com port 9, but you may need to check
   which com port is available using Windows Device Manager.
   
2. Monitor button signals and decode status using a hyperterminal application
   or the Profilab executable provided.  (On Windows 7 you can use a free 
   hyperterminal alternative such as RealTerm.)  
   
   The Profilab mTouch GUI executable is located in the project subfolder
   
       .\ProfiLabGUIs\mTouch GUI\Executable

   After the executable is launched, you will notice 7 icons on the upper right
   side of the GUI window.  The are, from left to right:
   
      Load Settings (F3) (Folder Icon)
      Save Settings (F2) (Diskette Icon)
      Print Front Panel (F5) (Printer Icon)
      Copy Front Panel to Clipboard (F4) (Clipboard Icon)
      Configuration: Application (Red Screwdriver Icon)
      Configuration: Hardware (F6) (Red Screwdriver Icon)
      Configuration: Front Panel (F7) (Hammer/Wrench Icon)

    Hit F6 and verify the serial interface is using the correct com port on
    your PC.  If it is you should be seeing activity on the GUI.  Try to 
    assert buttons or a slider value and verify the correct activity shows up
    on the GUI.  The plots will show the measured voltage (in adjusted ADC
    counts) for each of the capacitors on the daughter card.  The GUI will
    also show you the decoded button or slider status.  You can use these
    signals to tune the settings in mTouchConfig.h to improve sensitivity and 
    noise immunity.

3.  IF THE GUI DOESN'T WORK

    If nothing is happening on the GUI:
    
    3.1 Verify that the red "Busy" LED on the PICKit Serial Analyzer is lit.
        If it isn't reset the PICKit Serial Analyzer by pressint its button
        until all LEDs are lit.  You should now see activity on the GUI.
        
    3.2 Verify that the GUI is using the correct com port by checking the
        Windows Device Manager under "Ports (COM & LPT)"
        
    3.3 If the GUI still doesn't work, check that there is activity on the
        com port using a hyperterminal.  If there is no activity you need 
        to reboot your PC and start over. (Sorry, that's the best we can do.)

  Microchip has provide the Profilab mTouch GUI as an aid to development.

  We have found Profilab to be a useful tool, costing less than 100 Euros.

  If the GUI executable is helpful, your welcome.  

  But Microchip cannot provide additional support for it, other than giving
  out the Profilab project and a compiled executable. If it doesn't work
  you're on your own. (Sorry.)

  If the GUI still doesn't work you can still capture com port traffic 
  with a hyperterminal application and plot the results using Excel or 
  Open Office's Calc.

A Note on Charge/Discharge Cycles
---------------------------------

The number of charge/discharge cycles required to bring an unasserted button to
Vdd/2 (3.3/2) depends on the button's capacitance, which varies from board to
board.  The number of cycles is defined in mTouchConfig.h by:

        /*
          Charge/discharge cycles for Rev 1 and Rev 2

          Multiple cycles needed because ADC's sample and hold (SAH)
          capacitor is much smaller than typical button capacitor.

         */
        // Also used for Rev 3, Vpositive
        #define CHARGE_DISCHARGE_CYCLE_1
        //#define CHARGE_DISCHARGE_CYCLE_2
        //#define CHARGE_DISCHARGE_CYCLE_3
        //#define CHARGE_DISCHARGE_CYCLE_4


Checking For Correct Button 'Scope Signals
------------------------------------------

You never really know if the application is working to peak performance without
examining the signals at each button capacitor.  For that you will need a good
active single-ended 'scope probe, such as a Tektronix 6245, with a probe 
capacitance less than 1 pF.  Put channel one on the button capacitor signal and
channel two on the reference channel. (Use a regular probe on channel two.)

The Powerpoint briefing, 

    "Additional Information for dsPIC33F and dsPIC33 CVD Demos.pdf", 

has examples of button signals, both unasserted and asserted.

     HERE'S WHERE WE WARN YOU ABOUT PROJECT FEATURES YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE.

1) ==>TimerCallbackFunc0 optimization<==
The optimization of this function is left at Level Zero to prevent the compiler
from "optimizing" the CVD measurement timings.  Changing the optimization from 
this seems to break the algorithm.
