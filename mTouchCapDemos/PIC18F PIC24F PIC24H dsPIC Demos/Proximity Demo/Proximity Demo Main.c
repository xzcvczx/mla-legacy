 *  Project Name:    mTouch Library
 *  FileName:        Proximity Demo Main.c
 *  Dependencies:    system.h, mTouch.h
 *  Processor:       PIC18, PIC24, dsPIC
 *  Compiler:        HI-TECH, MPLAB C18, XC8, MPLAB C30, XC16
 *  IDE:             MPLAB® IDE or MPLAB® X                        
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *  Description:     This demo explains how to use mTouch basic button as
 *                   a proximity sensor. 8 buttons plugin module must be
 *                   connected to the low part of the sensors connector
 *                   (channels from 0 to 7). The button '8' 
 *                   indicates press/release state on hand approach.
 *                   LED 15 shows that the proximity sensor is still 
 *                   initializing.
 *
 *                   Noise from debugger/programmer can influence on operation.
 *                   Disconnect programmer/debugger from the board for
 *                   the correct operation.
