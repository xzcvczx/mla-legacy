 *  Project Name:    mTouch Library
 *  FileName:        PIC24FJXXXGA3XXScanInSleep.h
 *  Dependencies:    mTouch.h
 *  Processor:       PIC24F
 *  Compiler:        MPLAB C30, XC16

 *  Description:     This demo explains how to perform scanning of the
 *                   capasitive sensors in sleep for PIC24FJXXXGA3XX devices.
 *                   These devices have a hardware implementation of mTouch
 *                   functionality. In sleep CTMU charges sensors and 
 *                   ADC gets samples. If the sample value is less than
 *                   a threshold set in hardware the PIC wakes up.
 *                   For additional inforamtion about this feature please
 *                   read:
 *                   PIC24F Family Ref. Manual, "Section 51. 12-Bit A/D
 *                   Converter with Threshold Detect"
 *                   and
 *                   PIC24F Family Ref. Manual, "Section 53. Charge Time
 *                   Measurement Unit (CTMU) with Threshold Detect"
