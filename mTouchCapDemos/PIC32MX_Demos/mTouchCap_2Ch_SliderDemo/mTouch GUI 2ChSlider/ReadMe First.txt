In order to Build or run the CVD GUI, you need to import a macro used by the application called MinMax. You need to :

1. open ProfiLab Pro
2. Click the File menu
3. Choose Import Macro
4. Browse to the project directory
4. Select the MinMax.mak file
5. Hit OK

The file should now be registered and the MinMax Chip should appear in the Macro group of ProFilab.

6. Finally, just load the GUI project file and run or compile normally.
