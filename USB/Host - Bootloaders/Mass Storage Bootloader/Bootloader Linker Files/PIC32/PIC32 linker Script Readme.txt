The PIC32 Bootloader linker script is placed in the project folder and is named procdefs.ld

Refer to the Getting Started Help file for details on modification to be made to the procdefs.ld when compiler size optimization is disabled.

Note that the procdefs.ld file is not explicitly included in the PIC32 USB Host Bootloader workspace. The file is picked up by project by default.
