The MCHPUSB bootloader is obsolete and is no longer supported.
To reduce the package size of the Microchip Libraries for 
Applications (MLA) package, and to discourage any further
development using the MCHPUSB bootloader, the source code
has been removed.

Please use the HID bootloader for all new designs.

If for reference purposes you wish to refer to the original 
firmware associated with the MCHPUSB bootloader, the code
is present in the Microchip Libraries for Applications (MLA)
v2013-02 release (and older).
