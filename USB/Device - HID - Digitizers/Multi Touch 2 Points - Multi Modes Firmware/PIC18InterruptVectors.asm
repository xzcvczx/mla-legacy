;Important Notes regarding clock switching to 31kHz INTRC during USB Suspend
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;During USB suspend, a USB device is required to reduce its total Vbus power
;consumption to no more than 2.5mA, in order to successfully pass USB compliance
;tests.  In an application that is bus powered, this 2.5mA or less current 
;consumption is normally achieved by placing the microcontroller into either sleep
;mode, or by clock switching to a lower frequency clock source (ex: the 31kHz INTRC).

;If the microcontroller firmware wishes to clock switch to a very low frequency
;clock source, such as 31kHz, then special considerations can become necessary.

;During an interrupt event in a C18 based project, the interrupt handler routine
;will execute some code to perform context saving operations.  The C compiler
;manages certain registers and resources (ex: such as pointers, intermediate variables
;used during mathematical operations, etc.), which may need to get saved during the
;interrupt context save (in addition to the standard registers, such as BSR, 
;WREG, STATUS).  This C compiler context save can take a relatively long time
;to execute.  At a PIC18 microcontroller frequency of 48MHz, a context save
;operation may take approximately 10us.  At 31kHz, the operation will take much
;longer (ex: ~15ms).

;When a USB host wakes up a USB bus segment from the USB  suspend state, it will 
;do so by sending non-idle bus signalling to the device (normally a special 
;"resume" event, which is a driven 'K' state).  This will trigger the 
;UIR, ACTVIF interrupt flag, allowing the microcontroller firmware to know that 
;it should wake up from sleep and/or clock switch back to the primary clock 
;source (back to settings compatible with normal USB operation).

;Once the host has sent the special resume signalling, the host is required
;to wait a minimum of 10ms to allow for a "recovery interval."  This interval 
;is intended to allow the USB device to finish waking up and prepare itself to 
;begin receiving new USB commands/traffic.  The USB device is required to be 
;ready to communicate and respond to traffic at the end of the 10ms interval.

;If the microcontroller clock switched to 31kHz at the start of the USB suspend
;condition, a problem can occur if the interrupt context save operation (caused
;by the UIR, ACTVIF interrupt event) takes the full ~15ms (at 31kHz).  In this 
;scenario, the USB device firmware may not be ready in time to receive the 
;first USB packets sent from the host following the resume recovery interval.

;To avoid this potential problem, the microcontroller firmware should quickly 
;switch back to the primary clock source, after the UIR,ACTVIF interrupt has
;occurred, but prior to performing the interrupt context save operation.  
;In this way, the context save operation can take place at a much higher 
;frequency (ex: the full 48MHz), and therefore can be completed much quicker 
;than the 10ms recovery interval.  The USB device will therefore be fully
;ready to begin receiving USB traffic well before the 10ms recovery interval
;has elapsed.
