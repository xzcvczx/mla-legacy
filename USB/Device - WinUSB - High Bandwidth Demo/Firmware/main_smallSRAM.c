//NOTE: This main_smallSRAM.c is a small USB SRAM version of the
//main.c file used for the USB Device - WinUSB - High Bandwidth Demo
//firmware project.

//The demo code in the main.c is "superior" and should be used as
//an educational reference instead of the code in this (main_smallSRAM.c)
//file.  However, the main.c demo code uses up to three endpoints
//simultanouesly, with 64-byte buffers, with full-ping pong buffering
//enabled and used.  This requires 384 bytes of USB module accessible
//SRAM, in addition to the BDT and endpoint 0 buffers.

//However, some lower cost PIC18 USB microcontrollers do not have this
//much USB accessible SRAM, and are limited to 256 bytes
//(PIC18F14K50/13K50 and PIC18F4450/2450 devices).  These lower
//cost microcontrollers are however still capable of achieving
//high bandwidth full speed USB data transmission rates, approaching
//the theoretical maximum limit of the USB specifications (~1.2MB/s
//after accounting for required USB protocol overhead).

//In order to make this demo still work on these devices, with the 
//same PC application demo program (HighBandwidthWinUSB.exe), 
//this main_smallSRAM.c file uses less SRAM by re-using
//two 64-byte blocks of SRAM for all of the enabled even/odd
//endpoint buffers.  No real application should ever do this, as
//it would result in uncontrolled overwriting of the data buffers.

//If you need to develop a high bandwidth USB application using one
//of these low cost, small memory USB microcontrollers, it is
//suggested to use the code of main.c instead.  The required USB
//accessible SRAM needed can be significantly reduced by modifing
//the project so that either less total endpoints are enabled, and/or 
//that each endpoint uses a smaller maximum endpoint size 
//(ex: 32-bytes instead of 64-bytes).  This will allow 
//the application to fit within the SRAM contraints of the 
//target microcontroller.

//	firmware needs some means to detect when Vbus is being powered by the host.
//	A 5V tolerant I/O pin can be connected to Vbus (through a resistor), and
// 	can be used to detect when Vbus is high (host actively powering), or low
//	(host is shut down or otherwise not supplying power).  The USB firmware
// 	can then periodically poll this I/O pin to know when it is okay to turn on
//	the USB module/D+/D- pull up resistor.  When designing a purely bus powered
//	peripheral device, it is not possible to source current on D+ or D- when the
//	host is not actively providing power on Vbus. Therefore, implementing this

	//All currently existing Microchip USB microcontroller use a dedicated Direct
	//Memory Access (DMA) interface allowing the USB module to directly read or
	//write USB packets into or out of microcontroller SRAM.  To receive an "OUT"
	//packet from the host (in USB terminology, OUT and IN are always from the host's
	//perspective), the microcontroller firmware needs to "arm" the Buffer
	//Descriptor Table (BDT) for the endpoint that the data will be received on.
	//The BDT entry is a small set of special function registers (SFRs) that
	//control the operation of the DMA transaction (number of bytes to receive,
	//pointer to where in SRAM the data should be placed, etc.).  Depending upon
	//the USB module configuration, there will be many BDT entries, as each
	//combination of endpoint number, endpoint direction, and endpoint 
	//"even/odd-ness" (when ping-pong buffering is enabled), needs a dedicated 
	//set of SFRs for controling the DMA behavior when the host tries to read/write
	//to the respective endpoint.
	
    
    //As the device completes the enumeration process, the USBCBInitEP() function will
    //get called.  In this function, we initialize the user application endpoints (in this
    //example code, the user application makes use of EP1 OUT, EP2 OUT, EP3 OUT).
    //The USBTransferOnePacket() function calls in the USBCBInitEP() function initializes an endpoint
    //and "arms" it so that it can receive a packet of data from the host.  Once the endpoint
    //has been armed, the host can then send data to it (assuming some kind of application software
    //is running on the host, and the application software tries to send data to the USB device).

    //If the host sends a packet of data to the endpoint 1 OUT buffer, the hardware of the SIE will
    //automatically receives it and stores the data at the memory location pointed to when we called
    //USBTransferOnePacket().  Additionally, the endpoint handle will indicate
    //that the endpoint is no longer busy.  At this point, it is safe for this firmware to begin reading
    //from the endpoint buffer, and processing the data.  In this example, we don't actually do anything
    //with the data that is received from the host, since this demo is simply meant to show high bandwidth
    //USB communication.
    
    //This demo makes full use of the "ping-pong" buffering features implemented 
    //by the USB module hardware.  Ping-pong buffering is like a "DMA FIFO".  
    //It enables up to two transactions to be queued up on a single endpoint.
    //While the firmware may be processing and using previously received data,
    //the USB module hardware can be configured to still receive the next packet
    //of data that may be sent from the host.
    
    
    //As an example in the below code, if the USB host tries to send 273 bytes
    //to "Endpoint 1 OUT", the following sequence will occur:
    
    //1. The first set of bytes (0-63) will arrive in the EP1OUTEvenBuffer[].
    //2. The next set of bytes (64-127) will arrive in the EP1OUTOddBuffer[].
    //3. Assuming the firmware re-armed the EP1OUTEven BDT, then the next set of
   	//		bytes (128-191) will arrive in the EP1OUTEvenBuffer[].
    //4. Assuming the firmware re-armed the EP1OUTOdd BDT, then the next set of
   	//		bytes (192-255) will arrive in the EP1OUTOddBuffer[].  
    //5. Assuming the firmware re-armed the EP1OUTEven BDT, then the next set of
   	//		bytes (256-272) will arrive in the EP1OUTEvenBuffer[]. This completes
   	//		the transfer, as the host has successfully sent 273 bytes total (0-272).
  	
   	//If after successfully completing the above 273 byte transfer, and the host
   	//wants to start another transfer and send another 75 bytes, the following
   	//will occur:
   	
    //6. Assuming the firmware re-armed the EP1OUTOdd BDT, then bytes (0-63) 
    //		will arrive in the EP1OUTOddBuffer[].  
    //7. Assuming the firmware re-armed the EP1OUTEven BDT, then the next set of
   	//		bytes (64-74) will arrive in the EP1OUTEvenBuffer[]. This completes
   	//		the transfer, as the host has successfully sent 75 bytes total (0-74).

   	//In the above sequence, if the firmware had not gotten around to re-arming
   	//the EP1OUTEven BDT by step #3, then the EP1 OUT endpoint will continuously
   	//NAK until the firmware eventually does re-arm the EP1OUTEven BDT.  This
   	//NAKing will temporarily halt the data flow, but it does not cause data to
   	//be lost.  The host will continue to retry sending the data until it is
   	//received successfully, or, the host PC application that is sending the data
   	//aborts the operation.  The PC application software can be written to

// ******************************************************************************************************
// The USB firmware stack will call the callback functions USBCBxxx() in response to certain USB related

// packets to your device.  In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease their power
// consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA each.  The USB module detects this condition (which according
// to the USB specifications is 3+ms of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend()
// function.  You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
// conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
// consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the
// microcontroller to sleep, etc.).  Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then wish to
// add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.

// The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not automatically call this
// function.  This function is meant to be called from the application firmware instead.  See the
// additional comments near the function.

// Note *: The "usb_20.pdf" specs indicate 500uA or 2.5mA, depending upon device classification. However,
// the USB-IF has officially issued an ECN (engineering change notice) changing this to 2.5mA for all

 * Output:          None

 * Side Effects:    None
 *
 * Overview:        The USB specifications allow some types of USB
 * 					peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
 *					as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
 *					This can be a very useful feature in some
 *					USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
 *					control	receiver.  If a user presses the "power"
 *					button on a remote control, it is nice that the
 *					IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
 *					send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
 *					
 *					The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
 *					to send this special USB signalling which wakes 
 *					up the PC.  This function may be called by
 *					application firmware to wake up the PC.  This
 *					function will only be able to wake up the host if
 *                  all of the below are true:
 *					
 *					1.  The USB driver used on the host PC supports
 *						the remote wakeup capability.
 *					2.  The USB configuration descriptor indicates
 *						the device is remote wakeup capable in the
 *						bmAttributes field.
 *					3.  The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
 *						and has previously sent your device a SET 
 *						FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
 *						remote wakeup capability.   
 *
 *                  If the host has not armed the device to perform remote wakeup,
 *                  then this function will return without actually performing a
 *                  remote wakeup sequence.  This is the required behavior, 
 *                  as a USB device that has not been armed to perform remote 
 *                  wakeup must not drive remote wakeup signalling onto the bus;
 *                  doing so will cause USB compliance testing failure.
 *                  
 *					This callback should send a RESUME signal that
 *                  has the period of 1-15ms.
 *
 * Note:            This function does nothing and returns quickly, if the USB
 *                  bus and host are not in a suspended condition, or are 
 *                  otherwise not in a remote wakeup ready state.  Therefore, it
 *                  is safe to optionally call this function regularly, ex: 
 *                  anytime application stimulus occurs, as the function will
 *                  have no effect, until the bus really is in a state ready
 *                  to accept remote wakeup. 
 *
 *                  When this function executes, it may perform clock switching,
 *                  depending upon the application specific code in 
 *                  USBCBWakeFromSuspend().  This is needed, since the USB
 *                  bus will no longer be suspended by the time this function
 *                  returns.  Therefore, the USB module will need to be ready
 *                  to receive traffic from the host.
 *
 *                  The modifiable section in this routine may be changed
 *                  to meet the application needs. Current implementation
 *                  temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
 *                  period of ~3-15 ms depending on the core frequency.
 *
 *                  According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
 *                  "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
 *                  for at least 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
 *                  The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
 *                  common value that would work over a wide range of core
 *                  frequencies.
 *                  That value selected is 1800. See table below:
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  Core Freq(MHz)      MIP         RESUME Signal Period (ms)
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                      48              12          1.05
 *                       4              1           12.6
 *                  ==========================================================
 *                  * These timing could be incorrect when using code
 *                    optimization or extended instruction mode,
 *                    or when having other interrupts enabled.
 *                    Make sure to verify using the MPLAB SIM's Stopwatch
 *                    and verify the actual signal on an oscilloscope.
