 *  
 *    The licenses for most software are designed to

 * we gave you and make

 *  
 * Legal Terms 
 *  
 * 0. Definitions: 
 *    Throughout this License, "Font" means the TrueType 
 * fonts "AR PL 
 * Mingti2L Big5", "AR PL KaitiM Big5" (BIG-5 character 
 * set) and "AR PL 
 * SungtiL GB", "AR PL KaitiM GB" (GB character set) 
 * which are originally

 * fonts created 
 * through any modification including modifying glyph, 
 * reordering glyph, 
 * converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting 
 * some 
 * characters in/from glyph table. 
 *  
 *    "PL" means "Public License". 
 *  
 *    "Copyright Holder" means whoever is named in 
 * the copyright or 
 * copyrights for the Font. 
 *  
 *    "You" means the licensee, or person copying, 
 * redistributing or 
 * modifying the Font. 
 *  
 *    "Freely Available" means that you have the freedom 
 * to copy or modify 
 * the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font 
 * under the same 
 * conditions you received, not price. If you wish, 
 * you can charge for this 
 * service. 
 *  
 * 1. Copying & Distribution 
 *    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of 
 * this Font in any 
 * medium, without restriction, provided that you retain 
 * this license file 
 * (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies. 
 *  
 * 2. Modification 
 *    You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font 
 * in any way, including 
 * modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, 
 * changing font 
 * name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from 
 * glyph table, and copy 
 * and distribute such modifications under the terms 
 * of Section 1 above, 
 * provided that the following conditions are met: 
 *  
 *    a) You must insert a prominent notice in each 
 * modified file stating 
 * how and when you changed that file. 
 *  
 *    b) You must make such modifications Freely Available 
 * as a whole to 
 * all third parties under the terms of this License, 
 * such as by offering 
 * access to copy the modifications from a designated 
 * place, or 
 * distributing the modifications on a medium customarily 
 * used for software 
 * interchange. 
 *  
 *    c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands 
 * interactively when 
 * run, you must cause it, when started running for 
 * such interactive use in 
 * the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement 
 * including an 
 * appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there 
 * is no warranty (or 
 * else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that 
 * users may 
 * redistribute the Font under these conditions, and 
 * telling the user how 
 * to view a copy of this License. 
 *  
 *    These requirements apply to the modified work 
 * as a whole. If 
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived 
 * from the Font, and 
 * can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
 * works in 
 * themselves, then this License and its terms, do 
 * not apply to those 
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works. 
 * Therefore, mere 
 * aggregation of another work not based on the Font 
 * with the Font on a 
 * volume of a storage or distribution medium does 
 * not bring the other work 
 * under the scope of this License. 
 *  
 * 3. Condition Subsequent 
 *    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute 
 * the Font except 
 * as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
 * otherwise to copy, 
 * modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically 
 * retroactively void your rights under this License. 
 * However, parties who 
 * have received copies or rights from you under this 
 * License will keep 
 * their licenses valid so long as such parties remain 
 * in full compliance. 
 *  
 * 4. Acceptance 
 *    You are not required to accept this License, 
 * since you have not 
 * signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
 * to copy, modify, 
 * sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions 
 * are prohibited by law 
 * if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
 * copying, modifying, 
 * sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate 
 * your acceptance of 
 * this License and all its terms and conditions. 
 *  
 * 5. Automatic Receipt 
 *    Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient 
 * automatically 
 * receives a license from the original licensor to 
 * copy, distribute or 
 * modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. 
 * You may not 
 * impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
 * exercise of the 
 * rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
 * enforcing compliance 
 * by third parties to this License. 
 *  
 * 6. Contradiction 
 *    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
 * of patent 
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
 * to patent issues), 
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
 * order, agreement or 
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
 * License, they do not 
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License. 
 * If you cannot distribute 
 * so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
 * under this License and 
 * any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
 * you may not 
 * distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent 
 * license would not 
 * permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by 
 * all those who receive 
 * copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
 * the only way you could 
 * satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
 * entirely from 
 * distribution of the Font. 
 *  
 *    If any portion of this section is held invalid 
 * or unenforceable under 
 * any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
 * section is intended to 
 * apply and the section as a whole is intended to 
 * apply in other 
 * circumstances. 
 *  
 * 7. NO WARRANTY 
 *    BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
 * THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
 * THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
 * LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS 
 * OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * PROVIDE THE FONT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
 * KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED 
 * WARRANTIES OF 
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
 * THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH 
 * YOU. SHOULD THE FONT 
 * PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
 * SERVICING, REPAIR 
 * OR CORRECTION. 
 *  
 * 8. DAMAGES WAIVER 
 *    UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO 
 * IN WRITING, IN NO 
 * EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY 
 * OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
 * LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY 
 * DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL 
 * OR EXEMPLARY 
 * DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
 * THE FONT (INCLUDING 
 * BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS 
 * OR SERVICES; LOSS OF 
 * USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), 
 * EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR 
 * OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
 * OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 * If you cannot distribute 
 * so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
 * under this License and 
 * any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
 * you may not 
 * distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent 
 * license would not 
 * permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by 
 * all those who receive 
 * copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
 * the only way you could 
 * satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
 * entirely from 
 * distribution of the Font. 
 *  
 *    If any portion of this section is held invalid 
 * or unenforceable under 
 * any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
 * section is intended to 
 * apply and the section as a whole is intended to 
 * apply in other 
 * circumstances. 
 *  
 * 7. NO WARRANTY 
 *    BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
 * THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
 * THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
 * LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS 
 * OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * PROVIDE THE FONT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
 * KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED 
 * WARRANTIES OF 
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
 * THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH 
 * YOU. SHOULD THE FONT 
 * PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
 * SERVICING, REPAIR 
 * OR CORRECTION. 
 *  
 * 8. DAMAGES WAIVER 
 *    UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO 
 * IN WRITING, IN NO 
 * EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY 
 * OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
 * LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY 
 * DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL 
 * OR EXEMPLARY 
 * DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
 * THE FONT (INCLUDING 
 * BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS 
 * OR SERVICES; LOSS OF 
 * USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), 
 * EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR 
 * OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
 * OF SUCH DAMAGES.
