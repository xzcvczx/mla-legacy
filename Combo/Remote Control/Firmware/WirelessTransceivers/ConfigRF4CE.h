      This definition defines how MCU behaves in power saving mode. If this
      definition is defined, MCU will go to sleep during idle time of duty
      cycle and be waken up by watch dog timer (WDT). Due to the fact that
      the WDT can only be configured to timeout at certain interval, it
      cannot be sure that it will wake up every 983.2 ms (1 second - 16.8ms)
      specified by the specification. The result is that there is a small
      chance (1.68% + inacuracy of WDT), that the packet cannot be received
      by the target device. User has two options:
        1. Keep the MCU awake, where the MCU keep track of timing precisely.
           In this case, just comment out this definition
        2. Tolerate the small chance of failure, or reduce the duty cycle to
           be 500ms to ensure 100% delivery of message in power save mode. Even if
           duty cycle is reduced to be 500ms the power consumption is still much
           lower than the option 1. In this case, uncomment this definition.
