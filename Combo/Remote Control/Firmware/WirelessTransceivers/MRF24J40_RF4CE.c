#warning The Remote control demo source code does not include RF4CE source code. To evaluate RF4CE demo, please program the PIC with the pre-programmed HEX file ‘Combo - Remote Control PIC24_DA210_RCB_RF4CE.hex’ located in the Precompiled Hex folder. To develop your application with RF4CE stack, please contact local Microchip Sales to request the RF4CE source code (RF4CE.c; MRF24J40_RF4CE.c).
