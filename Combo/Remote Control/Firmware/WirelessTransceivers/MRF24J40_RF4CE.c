#warning The Remote control demo source code does not include RF4CE source code. To evaluate RF4CE demo, please program the PIC with the pre-programmed HEX file ‘Remote Control-C30-PIC24FJ256DA210-RCB-RF4CE.hex’ located in the Pre-compiled Hex folder. To develop your application with RF4CE stack, please contact local Microchip Sales to request the RF4CE source code (RF4CE.c; MRF24J40_RF4CE.c).
