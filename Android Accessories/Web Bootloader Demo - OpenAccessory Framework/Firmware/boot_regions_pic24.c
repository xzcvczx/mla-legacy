// The my_boot_regions array holds the ranges that will be bootloaded.
//  The boot regions need to be page aligned.
//  If changing the boot regions, make sure to change the linker file as well.
//  Make sure the number of boot regions in my_boot_regions equals the NUM_BOOT_REGIONS constant in boot_config.h
//  The syntax for adding more regions is the following:
//      my_boot_regions[] = {{startAddress1, endAddress1}, {startAddress2, endAddress2}, ... {startAddressN, endAddressN}}
ROM BOOT_REGION my_boot_regions[] = {{0x00003000, 0x00006000}};
