  Function:
    void EraseBootRegions(void)

  Description:
    This routine will erase the entire application memory space.

  Precondition:
    Each boot region is page aligned (Starts on address divisible by
    FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE and ends on address divisible by FLASH_BLOCK_SIZE)

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:

  Precondition:
    The number of bytes within *buffer will fit the entire range given by *entry

  Parameters:
    BOOT_REGION *entry  - The address range that we will write to
    BYTE *buffer        - A pointer to the buffer that holds the instructions

  Precondition:
    The validation code is saved at the beginning of the region.

  Parameters:
