Microsoft is likely to update the WinUSB driver in the future.  
Currently (May 2009) a beta version, which is newer than that
provided here exists, but is not being distributed here since it
is stil in beta.  Any new WinUSB driver versions provided by Microsoft
are likely to be distributed in the WDK (Windows Driver Kit) connection
at: connect.microsoft.com (which is currently free but requires a login).

Any new versions are likely to require a few minor changes to the .inf file
to work properly.
